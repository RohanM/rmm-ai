## Simple Transformer
[Simple Transformer](https://github.com/rohanm/simple-transformer) is a from-scratch implementation of a decoder-only
transformer language model, written with PyTorch and trained on Jane Austen.

- Character tokenisation
- Multi-headed masked self-attention
- Pre-norm & dropout regularisation
